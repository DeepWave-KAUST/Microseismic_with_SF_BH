# Project structure
This repository is organized as follows:

* :open_file_folder: **asset**: folder containing logo;
* :open_file_folder: **data**: folder containing data for network training;
* :open_file_folder: **MEDL**: python libraries containing the main code and all packages;
* :open_file_folder: **network**: folder used for holding the trained networks;
* :open_file_folder: **scripts**: python scripts used to run experiments;

## Getting started :space_invader: :robot:
To ensure reproducibility of the results, we suggest using the `environment.yml` file when creating an environment.

Simply run:
```
./install_env.sh
```
It will take some time, if at the end you see the word `Done!` on your terminal you are ready to go. 

Remember to always activate the environment by typing:
```
conda activate forge
```

**Disclaimer:** All experiments have been carried on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.10GHz equipped with a single NVIDIA RTX A6000. Different environment 
configurations may be required for different combinations of workstation and GPU.


## Data preparation
Download a synthetic dataset for training the network from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xYRV29qgmPVYZI_T-ziKr1AHsqL4Cpm0?usp=sharing). Please kindly place them inside the data directory.


## Run experiments
Go to the folder ```scripts``` and run in the terminal:
```
bash run.sh
```
